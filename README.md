LAN and WAN designs, the final project of the ACN course at IIIT Hyderabad. 

### LAN Design
Design LAN for the locality you are staying right now - Apartment/Township/Colony/Village/Hostel/etc. You need to address the following aspects:

- Topological design
- Choice of cables at various levels
- Choice of switching devices - types/category of the device, port speed, L2/L3
- IP Addressing schema

State your assumptions, justify your choices. A detailed design is expected, discussing the specifics of each aspect/component required for implementing the LAN.
